# Password Generator
Right now you'll have to figure out how to compile this yourself.  I'll work
out how to distribute it later.

## Options
* -l, --length <50>: How long the password should be
* -n, --percent-number <.25>: What percentage of the password should be numeric
* -s, --percent-symbol <.25>: What percentage of the password should use symbols
* --no-symbols: Do not use any symbols to create the password
