# Password Generator
Right now you'll have to figure out how to compile this yourself.  I'll work
out how to distribute it later.

## Options
* -l, --length &lt;50&gt;: How long the password should be
* -s, --symbols &lt;'!@#$%"'&gt;: Use this to define which symbols are allowed Enter `0` to not use any symbols. To use a single quote, concatenate with a double quoted string.  For example &lt;'!@#$%"'"'"&gt;
